# LIBFT-2020

Libft graded 115 by the holy moulinette on December 11, 2020. However, from times to times, I add some functions that were **not** in the subject but which can be usefull in the future. Therefore, in the file *RENDU-libft*, you will also find those complementary functions.

The `test-main.c` file only tests functions from the libft subject, not the complementary functions.
