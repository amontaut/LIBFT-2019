# LIBFT-2020

Libft graded 115 by the holy moulinette on December 11, 2020 with the Norm v2. However, from times to times, I add some functions that are **not** in the subject but which can be usefull in the future. Therefore, in the folder `FINAL-libft`, you will also find those complementary functions.

So, in this repo you will find : 
- FINAL-libft : where all the functions + makefile are
- SUBJECT-libft-fr.pdf : the subject in french ðŸ¥– 
- `test-main.c` : test file that only tests functions from the subject, not the complementary functions. To compile the test file, clone this repo then run `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror  test_main.c FINAL-libft/*.c && ./a.out`

In addition to my own little tester, I used Libftest (https://github.com/jtoty/Libftest), libft-unity (https://github.com/aurelien-brabant/libft-unity), libft-unit-test (https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test) and warmachine (https://github.com/ska42/libft-war-machine).
