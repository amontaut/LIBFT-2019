# LIBFT-2020

Libft graded 115 by the holy moulinette on December 11, 2020. However, from times to times, I add some functions that were **not** in the subject but which can be usefull in the future. Therefore, in the file *RENDU-libft*, you will also find those complementary functions.

The `test-main.c` file only tests functions from the libft subject, not the complementary functions. 

In addition to my own little tester, I used Libftest (https://github.com/jtoty/Libftest), libft-unity (https://github.com/aurelien-brabant/libft-unity), libft-unit-test (https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test) and warmachine (https://github.com/ska42/libft-war-machine).
